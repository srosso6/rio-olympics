A week-long assignment in week 5 of the 16-week programming course I attended at CodeClan. The aim was to consolidate and build upon what I had learned in the first 4 weeks including:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST / MVC )
- PostgreSQL databases with CRUD actions

This was an individual project in which I chose to create a CRUD app, allowing a user to track nations, athletes and event results in the Rio Olympics. The app was created using Sinatra, a lightweight Ruby web framework, and raw SQL coupled with solid Object Orientation, Test Driven Development and Git good practice. It uses a PostgreSQL database.

The CSS styling was developed from scratch without the use of frameworks.
